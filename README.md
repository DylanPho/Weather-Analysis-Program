# Weather Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project provides tools for analyzing weather data across various time periods using C++ for core functionality and MATLAB for data visualization. The program processes historical weather data, enabling users to analyze precipitation, snowfall, and temperature trends over time. Outputs include both textual reports and graphical plots.

## Features
### C++ Functionality
- Analyze Weather by Time Periods:
  -   By Year
  -   By Month
  -   Across Multiple Months
-   Precipitation Analysis:
  -   Total precipitation by year or month.
-   Snowfall Analysis:
  -   Total snowfall by year or month.
-   Temperature Analysis:
  -   Average, minimum, and maximum temperatures by year or month.

## MATLAB Integration
- Graphical plots of weather trends:
  - Average max temperatures over time.
  - Total annual rainfall.
  - Monthly and yearly temperature variations.
  - Snowfall trends.

## Usage
### C++ Program
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd WeatherDataAnalysis

3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o WeatherDataAnalysis

4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./WeatherDataAnalysis

5. Select the desired analysis option from the menu and input the required parameters.

## MATLAB Scripts
1. Open the provided MATLAB scripts in the scripts directory.
2. Load the relevant .txt data files as inputs for the scripts.
3. Run the script in MATLAB to generate plots.

## Outputs
- Text Reports:
  - Summary of weather trends.
  - Yearly and monthly statistics saved as .txt files.
- Graphs:
  - Generated by MATLAB to visualize trends over specified periods.

## Testing and Validation
The following tests were conducted to validate the program:
1. Average Maximum Recorded Temperature: Over 1909–2022.
2. Total Annual Rainfall: Over 1909–2022.
3. Minimum Recorded Temperature per Month: Over 1910–1915.
4. Average Mid-Day Temperature: Over 2000–2021.
Results confirmed data accuracy and alignment with expected weather patterns.
